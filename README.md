# asm341
An assembler for an assembly-like language I wrote to make my life easier when programming the microcontroller developed on an FPGA I made for homework for one of my classes.

By the way, I don't recommend actually using this, since a better one was provided by the professor. Making this was a good learning experience, at least.

For instructions on how to use this program, or details on how to write code to input into this program, see asm341_manual.pdf.
